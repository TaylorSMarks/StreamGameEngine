1. Having both a position setter and a move method appear to be coexisting... poorly. Either fix it or undo it.
2. Implement addText, changeText, addCountdown, and changeCountdown in the javascript side.
3. Track score, lives, and time on the Kotlin side.
4. When the countdown ends, decrement lives.
5. Buttons to join and start games...?
6. Meshes, not just sphere
    * Heart (Red)
    * Star (Yellow)
    * Cresent Moon (Purple)
    * Lightning Bolt (Orange)
    * Snowflake (White)
    * Rupee (Green)
    * Raindrop (Blue)
7. Notions of players and picking random players.
8. Position the camera appropriately and disallow moving it.
9. Also fix the damn issue where it keeps crashing based on the SSE Event streams being resized or whatever.
